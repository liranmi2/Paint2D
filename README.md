# Paint2D
This program is drawing a parallelogram, a circle and a Bezier curve by recieving 2 points from the user by clicking the mouse.

It will only allow you to draw it once at a time.

You may clear the screen by simply clicking the "clear" button, and draw again by clicking two points.

You may change the number of lines on the Bezier curve by clicking the up/down arrows on the bottom left side of the screen.
